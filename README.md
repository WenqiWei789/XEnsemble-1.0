## Introduction
XEnsemble is an advanced robust deep learning package that can defend both adversarial examples and out-of-distribution input(to-be-updated). The intuition behind is the input and model divergence of these attack inputs[1,5]. 

<!--
The code package has the following portals:
1. The attack portal(main_attack_portal.py): generate and save adversarial examples.
2. The input denoising robust prediction portal(input_denoising_portal.py): given an input, generate multiple denoised variants and feed them to the target model for prediction.
3. The input-model cross-layer defense portal(cross_layer_defense.py): given an input, generate multiple denoised variants and feed them to multiple diverse models for prediction.(detailed generation of diverse models can be found in [2,4]). We also compare our performance with four adversarial defenses: adversarial training, defensive distillation, input transformation ensemble as provided in the paper.
4. Comparison portal with detection-only adversarial defenses(detection_only_comparison.py): generate defense results of Feature Squeezing, MagNet, and LID. 
-->

XEnsemble now supports four datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet and LFW.
